# COLOUR-BASED-SORTING-SYSTEM-USING-CONVEYER-BELT

Sorting of products is a very difficult industrial process. Continuous manual sorting creates consistency issues. a working prototype designed for automatic sorting of objects based on the color. TCS230 sensor was used to detect the color of the product and the Arduino microcontroller was used to control the overall process. The identification of the color is based on the frequency analysis of the output of TCS230 sensor. conveyor belts were used, each controlled by separate DC motors. The belt is for placing the product to be analyzed by the color sensor, belt is for moving the container, having separated the all colours in the convey belt in order to separate the products. The experimental results promise that the prototype will fulfill the needs for higher production and precise quality in the field of automation.
